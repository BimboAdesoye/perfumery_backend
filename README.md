# PERFUME API

## DESCRIPTION
This project, as the title stated, is a Perfume Api with pseudo-real data created using Express.js. I built this to aid in my creation of an e-commerce website and I'm hosting it so others can perhaps use it for their own purposes.

The technologies used include:

-Node
-Nodemon
-mongoose
-ejs
-dotenv
-express

## Installation
1. Initialize node with "npm init -y"
2. Install the above technologies
3. Use npm run dev to run the server for development stage.
